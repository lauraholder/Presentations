History


After a 130-year legacy as a decidedly non-visual information offering, WSJ now embraces visual storytelling and experimentation, yet aims to retain it’s heritage identity, hallmarks of the brand, including hedcuts and “What’s News”, and typography:
First color photograph ever on front-page/homepage: 2007. (Was immediately taken down).
It was all about the written word, with only the most necessary embellishments (grayscale maps & charts).
Fonts/Typefaces even rooted in our legacy: Exchange/Escrow taken from the financial vernacular
As an org with such a strong history that we believe elevates our status, how do we pursue a timelessness without remaining stuck in the past? 
Refer to our core values. This helps us to resist decorative trends. 
So experience design is tied to the content - and in our case, how can we define and maintain a user-experience that gets out of the way of the content -- yet maintains WSJ identity, hews to our core values:
The standard at the time was period at end of publication titles, most pubs had (including NYT). We never dropped ours: it's an anchor to the past that we've chosen to retain as part of our identity - a nod to our history.
I like to think of it --perhaps as a bit of conceptual embellishment -- as a symbol connected to the dots in our hedcut “stipple/dot” drawings. (eg: the iconography on our site is round.) The stipples were also designed to look like money renderings.
Consistent “furniture”: brand, social tools; consistent UI elements (placemarkers, arrows, link styles, logo, form styles); “break the out of box” with UX patterns.
After we opened the floodgates to become a visually-rich medium (~10 years ago), we now have a healthy appetite for discovery and exploration in this (relatively) new frontier.
In many ways, now, discovery is more important to us than consistency 
It’s better to be correct than consistent  -- tell the story the way it needs to be told.
“Fail fast.” We have a fast-moving publishing cycle. Try things, learn from them, allow them into the field for multiple use-cases, to see what usage patterns arise by editors before they become institutionalized into reusable fixtures like apps and web templates. 
Everyone is R&D and “Innovation”, and good ideas can come from anywhere.

Try, fail, learn, revise, prove utility and usefulness ... then invest in reusability.


Guiding Principles 

Goal: Graphics as stories, not just supplements to stories. Weaving the right amount of reading with visuals to walk you through understanding. Data storytelling as a first-class citizen of journalism, not just sidebar to the main coverage: 
How can we organize data so more people consume it, understand it, and enjoy it?
Digital audience is much less captive than print readers. Come on strong with a premise.
Don’t hide essential information behind hovers, clicks
Missing from mobile
OK for delight and ease of non-essential data access, but best at the deeper-dive 
Minimal embellishment:
A near constant tension between experimentation and going “off brand”
Design should problem-solve: First identify the problem, or thesis
Don’t decorate, integrate ... 
Bells & Whistles
Animations should aid comprehension, and serve the content, not merely “spruce it up”. Serve the concept.
Good example of animation: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/27/opinion/automated-vehicles-cant-save-cities.html
“Bad” Example of less successful embellishment: https://classic.qz.com/happiness-experiment/
Bad: Dot markers obtuse
Good: Confetti maps to premice/concept

Data Dumps part 1: No data dumps
Except when we data-dump, eg: college rankings: https://www.wsj.com/graphics/college-rankings-2018-tool/
Data Dumps part 2: Instead, provide a takeaway or thesis up front, then allow for self-guided deeper-dive
CEO Pay evolution:

v2: http://graphics.wsj.com/ceopay-2015/ initial walk through
v3: https://www.wsj.com/graphics/ceopay-2017/ the story is the walkthrough the data, with option for self-driven deep dive

Design Process
Start with the data/premise/thesis, the story we’re telling: 
Who is it for? The wonk, the general audience, the finance-angle? Are we trying to reach new audiences or cater to our core users? 
What’s our guiding principle concept? The “quiddity” (The real nature of a thing; the essence). This is a beacon on which we’ll keep returning as we make design decisions.
Then organize content, carve out trajectory. Sometimes a solution comes from a JavaScript library or template….
Also this always changes!

When working with editors, it’s important to identify the thesis up front (or as journalists, sharing this with designers)
Get 5 draft headlines, even though you know they’ll change
Sometimes the overall premise changes!
One Lesson: Magic 8-ball Lesson Learned: We brainstormed this idea for a magic 8-ball, we wanted to tie it to the accelerometer and let you shake your phone and we’d write applicable messages like “BUY” and “SELL” and “MORNIGNSTAR SAYS TRY AGAIN LATER”. We were pretty in love with this idea, and had a lot of enthusiasm from viz ed and page one editor. But when we pitched it to the reporter, he gave us a hard “no”. We had to take his word for it, it wasn’t a battle we could win, and I’m still not sure he’s right, but we came up with a good 2nd concept. Which is why everyone says kill your darlings. 

In bespoke design: 
Get a headline conceit up front, or 5 draft headlines. It may not tell you the final word-count but you’ll be working with real potential premises.
Example: https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-employees-1486050443 
Aim for a target, design for flexibility/deviation.

Templates and tools are good for expediency and consistency, but can hinder experimentation or discovery. Uniformity is good, but not at the expense of bespoke or hyper-specific. Find patterns in storytelling and invest in tools and templates. But start with one-offs…

Then invest in templates and tools…. 
Case study:
Longform storytelling:
Snowfall! Longform, rich storytelling is upon us
First story took us 7 months to build, every edit and design tweak painstakingly implemented by hand
Second took us 3 months
Then we built a template, and now publish several a day
Then we saw how that template was being used… desire-paths, how were editors hacking the template? Then we evolved the template for even more usefulness and utility.
